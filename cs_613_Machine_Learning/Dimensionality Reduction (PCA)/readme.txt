CS 613 Machine Learning, Fall 2023
Homework 1 - Dimensionality Reduction

This readme.txt describes contents for Homework 1 for class CS 613 Machine Learning, Fall 2023 at Drexel University.

Contents:

1) Alec_Peterson_HW1_CS613.pdf 
* Contains the PDF writeup for this assignment, including theory questions of Part 1 and matplotlib figure for Part 2

2) HW1_Problem1.py
* Contains script that for Part 1d, finds principal components of observed data X 
* and for Part 1f calculates 1D projection of mean-centered data onto first principal component
* Prints out string and arrays/vectors for each problem

2) HW1_Problem2.py
* Contains script that performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on arrays generated from 154 Yale Faces Dataset
* Expects the images to be co-located in the same directory, i.e. filepath is "./yalefaces"
* Calculates principal components through singular value decomposition (SVD)
* Shows matplotlib figure generated by projecting mean-centered data onto first 2 principal components

3) HW_Problem3.py
* Script that creates eigenfaces.avi video file from projected-then-reconstructed images at filepath "./yalefaces/subject02.centerlight". 
* From k = 0 to k=1599, images are projected onto k(+1) principal components, which are then reconstructed, annotated, and eventually compiled all together into the video file.
* Due to 40x40 image resolution and from compression loss (when reconstructed) at low values of k, first ~200 k value annotations can challenging to see clearly
