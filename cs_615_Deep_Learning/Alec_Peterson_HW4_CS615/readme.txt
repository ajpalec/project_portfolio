Contents are as follows, with only code files as required for assignment:

1) Alec_Peterson_HW4_CS615.pdf 
* Contains the PDF writeup for this assignment.


2) Python files containing neural network classes, which inherit from abstract class Layer from Layer.py:
* InputLayer.py - z-scores input datamatrix
* SoftmaxLayer.py - Softmax activation function
* FullyConnectedLayer.py - Dense layer taking input with D dimensions and turning to K dimensions after multiplying by weights and adding biases.

3) Python files for objective functions:
* CrossEntropy.py


4) Python files for: Problem 2-5, and Problem 6 and associated input data files
* hw4_prob2-5.py - Produces plots per problems 2-5 in assignment
* hw4_prob6.py - Produces plots per problem 6 in assignment for neural network. Also prints accuracy for training and validation sets to console.
