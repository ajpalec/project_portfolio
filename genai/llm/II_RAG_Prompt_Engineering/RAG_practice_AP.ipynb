Emerging Research and Future Developments:  \\n• Highlighted ongoing research on Aetherisol's potential in atopic derm atitis.\\nSubject:  Medical Science Liaison (MSL) Notes - In-Depth Discussion on Aetherisol  \\nDate:  March 15, 2023  \\nProvider:  Dr. Olivia Reynolds  \\nTitle:  Rheumatologist  \\nInstitution:  Metropolitan Medical Center  \\nSummary of Key Discussion Points:  \\n1. Introduction:  \\n• Expressed gratitude fo r the opportunity to discuss Aetherisol, a novel interleukin -17 \\ninhibitor.  \\n• Discussed Aetherisol's recent approval and its potential impact on refractory \\nrheumatoid arthritis (RA) cases.  \\n2. Provider's Current Patient Cases:  \\n• Inquired about Dr. Reynolds' current patient cases considering Aetherisol.  \\n• Discussed three specific RA cases where Aetherisol demonstrated a remarkable 30% \\nimprovement in joint function within the first month.  \\n3. Efficacy and Clinical Data:  \\n• Presented recent c linical data supporting Aetherisol's efficacy.  \\n• Highlighted a 60% reduction in disease activity scores observed in a 6 -month clinical trial \\ninvolving 200 patients.  \\n4. Safety Profile:  \\n• Discussed Aetherisol's safety profile, emphasizing its low incidence of gastr ointestinal \\nside effects (2% reported).  \\n• Addressed concerns about adverse events, noting that no severe adverse events were \\nreported in long -term studies.  \\n5. Mechanism of Action:  \\n• Explained Aetherisol's unique mechanism of action targeting interleukin -17 pathwa ys. \\n• Quantified its efficacy by discussing a 45% reduction in inflammatory cytokines observed \\nin preclinical studies.  \\n6. Patient Adherence and Education:  \\n• Explored strategies for optimizing patient adherence, citing a 20% increase in adherence \\nrates when patien ts received personalized educational materials.  \\n7. Emerging Research and Future Developments:  \\n• Highlighted ongoing research on Aetherisol's potential in psoriatic arthritis.\\n\\n### Question:\\nUsing only the context above, What does Aetherisol treat?.\\n\\n### Response:\\n\""
