    "# Instruction Finetuning LLMs with QLoRA for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models are typically trained as models that simply predict the next word in a sequence.  While this leads to very powerful machines, they don't typically come equipped to deal with certain behaviors, such as following instructions.  In this lab, we will demonstrate how to fine tune a base Large Language Model to better respond to instructions with context, which is a requirement for RAG.  By fine tuning the model in this way, we can teach it to stop better, hallucinate less, and generally behave in a more desirable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Important Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "***We are finetuning a base model for RAG for instructional purposes on how finetuning can change the behavior of models. In practice, many models provide instruction fine-tuned models which will give better results than we can produce here for RAG because they are trained on many more data examples. For example (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 vs mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) and (meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf vs. meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf). Try and get the best performance out of the finetuning but don't expect it to work perfectly..***\n",

For example, if we wish for the model to follow instructions better with context, we should provide a dataset which gives examples of it following instructions provided with context.  **This is almost exactly like few-shot prompting, but reinforcing the behavior even further by actually modifying some of the weights of the model.**"

    "1. Pre-training/Full Finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this situation, all of the model weights (all 7b of them) are set to be trainable and tweaked during training.  This can lead to the most dramatic changes in model behavior but is also the most computationally expensive.  \n",

    "2. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameter efficient finetuning methods are an alternative to full finetuning where, instead of training the parameters of the pre-trained model, a subset of new parameters are trained without touching the base model weights. These new trainable parameters are injected into the model mathematically at different points to change the outcome.  There are a handful of methods that use this approach such as Prompt Tuning, P-Tuning, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).  For this lab, we will focus on LoRA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    LoRA methods introduce a set of trainable rank-decomposition matrices (update matrices) which can be used to modify the existing weights of the pre-trained model.  The typical location that these matrices are placed are within the attention layers, so they are not exclusive to LLMs.  The size of these update matrices can be controlled by  setting the desired rank of the matrix (`lora_r`), with smaller rank corresponding to smaller matrices and thus fewer trainable parameters.   During fine-tuning, only these update matrices are tuned and often times, this makes the total number of trainable parameters a very small fraction of the total number of weights.\n",

    "Now that we have prepared the data, loaded the model in 4-bit, and configured our LoRA finetuning according to our model, we are ready to train the model. Training of LLMs for generative purposes uses the causal language modeling objective.  Briefly, this specifies that when calculating attention, the model should only be able to consider things \"to the left\".  So for a sentence, it can only decide what to generate by looking at all of the words that came before it.  \n",

    "A very useful wrapper for training transformer based models is the Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer (`SFTrainer`) provided by the `trl` library.  While the supervised fine tuning is typically used in the context of reinforcement learning, for our purposes, it simply refers to providing the model with examples of input, and response.  All of the actual training, including computing gradients, tweaking the optimizer, batching the data, evaluation will be done behind the scenes using the `SFTrainer` wrapper.  This will conduct the finetuning that we want after we pass in the dataset and hyperparameters.  This is much more efficient and robust than writing our own training code."
