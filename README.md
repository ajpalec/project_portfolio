# Project Portfolio
Portfolio of data science and computer science projects, both personal and from MS in Data Science classes at Drexel University.

## dsci_511_Data_Preprocessing
* DSCI 511 - Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing using Python and other DS libraries (e.g. collections, BeautifulSoup, re, requests)
* Final project involved curating a dataset from a REST-ful API and spaCy

## dsci_521_Data_Analysis
* DSCI 521 - Data Analysis using Python, pandas, and other DS libraries
* Final project involved large-scale analysis of NYC Taxi and Share Ride dataset (>70 GB) using polars and pandas modules and plotly for visualization

## dsci_631_Applied_Machine_Learning
* DSCI 631 - Applied Machine Learning using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
* Final project involved prediction of wine review score (regression) testing regularized Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network
    * Used pre-trained transformers for sentiment analysis on unstructured text

## CS_504_OOP
* CS 504 - Introduction to Software Engineering, focusing on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) design patterns using Java

## cs_613_Machine_Learning
